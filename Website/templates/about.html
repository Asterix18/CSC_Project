    <h1 style="color: #3D84A8">About Predict Colorectal Cancer</h1>
    <p>
        Predict Colorectal Cancer utilises the capabilities of two state-of-the-art machine learning models designed for
        survival analysis (Random Survival Forests) in order to return survival probabilities. Below we outline the key
        metrics of our model to ensure transparency and build trust.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: #3D84A8">Model Training Data</h2>
    <p>
        The data set used for training the model was initially collected for the Cartes d’Identité des Tumeurs program
        from the French Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer. 386 of the records were used to train the model and the other
        69 records were used to test performance. More information on the data used can be found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39582">
        here<a>.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: #3D84A8">Model Metrics</h2>
    <p>
        <b>C-Index (5-year = 0.83, 10-year = 0.78):</b> Reflects the model's ability to correctly rank survival times. A
        value closer to 1 indicates a high degree of predictive accuracy in ranking, whereas a value closer to 0.5
        suggests performance similar to random chance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Average AUC (5-year = 0.91, 10-year = 0.84):</b> This value represents the model's ability to distinguish
        between different survival outcomes over a 10-year period. An AUC closer to 1 indicates a strong ability to
        differentiate between patients who will experience an event and those who will not within this timeframe.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Brier Score (5-year = 0.12, 10-year = 0.17):</b> This metric measures the accuracy of
        our probabilistic predictions and ranges between 0 and 1. A lower Brier score indicates more precise
        predictions, with 0 being perfectly accurate.
